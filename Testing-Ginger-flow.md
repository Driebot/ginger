**New Release**
-A new Ginger version will be available on Test, Acceptatie or Productie    
-Dorien/Fred let Kathleen/Margarida know when the new release is ready    
-There can be no new features added to the release once the ready sign had been 
given by Dorien/Fred    
-Kathleen/Margarida can see the change massages to see what specifics to look 
for while testing    
    
**Testing**    
-Kathleen/Margarida will update on Zotonic when they start testing    
-Kathleen/Margarida ask Marco to update data to the test server (if needed)    
-The release had to be testen on Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome and 
Ipad (Iphone?)    
-Kathleen/Margarida will divide the sites between them for testing and will 
switch this in the next stage, so that they both see each site before it 
goes live    
    
**Reporting**    
-Kathleen/Margarida will make one Gitlab-issue per release    
-For large bugs Kathleen/Margarida will make a separate issue on Gitlab    
-Kathleen/Margarida will asign the issues to Dorien or Fred, so they can assign 
them to other team members    
-Once Kathleen/Margarida find a significant bug they will communicate with     
-Dorien/Fred, so they can maybe fix it already. That way double work can be 
avoided    
-Kathleen/Margarida will report on which device/browser bugs occur    
-If a bug is complicated or includes multiple stept, Kathleen/Margarida will 
include the steps to reproduce the issue in the report     
-Kathleen/Margarida will add screenshots in links or under the post (with a 
reference to the bug) so that the post will remain readable    
-Kathleen/Margarida will make check-boxes which Dorien/Fred can check to show 
that certain issues are fixed    
-Kathleen/Margarida will cluster bugs from certain sites together, except when a
bug occurs on multiple site, then they will give an example of a site where 
things go wrong    
    
**Double check**    
-Dorien/Fred will check the boxes in the issue when they are fixed    
-Kathleen/Margarida will check if the issue is fixed    
-Kathleen/Margarida will give a ready sign to Dorien/Fred once all the testing 
is done.     
-Dorien/Fred will deploy the release to the next stage    
    
Once this flow is done, it will be repeated in the next fase. So it will be the 
same on Test, Acceptatie and Productie. Once a certain version of Ginger is 
release to Productie a newer version is added to Test.
