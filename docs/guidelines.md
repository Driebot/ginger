=================

   **General guidelines**

1. Always check whether a resource is **visible** before displaying it.

   **Building sites**

2. When overriding a base/foundation template, use `{% overrules %}` if
   possible. Only overwrite the blocks that you really need to overwrite.

3. Commit **bugfixes** to the current release branch.

4. Commit **new features** to the master branch.
