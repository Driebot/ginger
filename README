Provides frontend editing and resource connecting.

Usage:
 - add a predicate "Viewable connections" with name "viewable_predicates"
 - make this predicate valid for "category" to "predicate"
 - edit a category (like "project") and add "Viewable connections" (like: "about" and "relation")

On a "project" frontend page the sidebar should now show "add connections" buttons
